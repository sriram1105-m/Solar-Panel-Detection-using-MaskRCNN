# Solar-Panel-Detection-using-MaskRCNN

PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) solar energy conversion has become one of the most promising renewable power generation sources (i.e., solar energy and wind energy) in the energy sector to drive low-carbon energy provisioning across the world. Much of this growth is from distributed residential solar, which is most often solar panels on the roofs of houses. This distributed solar energy has been historically difficult to integrate into the electrical grid due to the two-way electricity flow created between times of high and low solar irradiance. Accurate real time predictions of the net energy added to the grid could be helpful for utility companies to manage the distributed solar energy contribution, especially in areas where solar energy can account for a significant portion of the daytime power production. As the number of solar installations continues to increase, they will become more difficult to track and monitor. The goal of this project is to develop a tool to locate solar panels in high resolution satellite images, which could passively and automatically monitor the size and location of distributed residential solar panels. In particular, high-resolution satellite remote sensing images and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms will be leveraged. More detailed objectives of this project are summarized as below. 

1.	Summarize the existing open-access satellite/UAV remote sensing datasets on solar panel mapping with details. 

2.	Learn how to download high-resolution satellite images (e.g. google earth images) and do the labelling by using some solar panel examples in Colchester area (choose labelling tools of your interest). 

3.	Building deep learning (e.g. transfer learning) models from the labelled datasets and verify its performance. 

4.	Apply the built model in different areas of interest in Colchester to generate the solar panel mapping and make a comparison for them.
